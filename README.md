# Coding quest
My repository for participating in [coding quest](codingquest.io).

## Plan
I am thinking of trying a different language for each series, and avoid Python if I can. My current plan:
- prac: R
- 2022: Rust
- 2023: JavaScript
- 2024: C or Go

All of this is subject to change, and of course I can also vary the language within the same series. :)
